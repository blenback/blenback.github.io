## Hi there!

I'm Ben a PhD student currently working within the [ValPar.CH](https://valpar.ch/index_de.php) project as part of the research group [Planning of Landscape Urban Systems (PLUS)](https://plus.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich. I'm a BIG fan of R stats for everything research related particularly for promoting open science and reproducibility. I started this site/blog to share some of my work that doesn't necessarily make it into publications in the hope that others will find it useful. Thanks for stopping by!
