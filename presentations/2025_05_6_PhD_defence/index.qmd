In June 2025, I defended my PhD thesis, titled identifying effective area-based conservation strategies under uncertainty, which represents the culmination of my last five years of research. Once the thesis is approved by the department committee and the final copy submitted I look forward to sharing the full document but for now here are the slides I presented on the day.
