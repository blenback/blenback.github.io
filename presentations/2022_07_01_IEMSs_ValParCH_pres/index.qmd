[These are the slides](iEMSs_ValPar_pres.pdf) for a presentation I gave on the integration of different modelling approaches within the [ValPar.CH](https://valpar.ch/index_en.php?page=home_en) project at the 11th International Environmental Modelling and Software Society (IEMSs) 2022 conference. The abstract is available [here.](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.20111.66720)
