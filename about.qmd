I thought I would share a little bit more about myself and how I've arrived at doing what I do. I would say that my route towards starting a PhD as a little bit unconventional, in fact I hadn't seriously considered it as an option until 3 months before I applied when a mentor told me they thought I might suit it. Following my Bachelors degree, I spent 5 years working in what I would loosely call 'practical conservation'. First for a charity called The Conservation Volunteers (TCV) in Scotland, leading groups of volunteers working on a range of projects from Peatland restoration and woodland management to constructing gardens in schools. Then taking a step into the unknown with a job at a small eco-tourism, conservation and community development NGO, Elephant Livelihood Initiative Environment, in rural North-Eastern Cambodia. In Cambodia, I saw first hand the reality of implementing environmental conservation programs in Protected areas and was really motivated to move towards a career in conservation practice which led to short periods of work with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). However, I knew that to continue in this field I would need to at least get a Masters degree.In 2018, I was lucky enough to be accepted into EU an Erasmus Mundus 2-year Masters program in Environmental Science Policy and Management. This started in Budapest in Hungary for the first 9 months before relocating to the island of Lesvos in Greece and then Manchester in the UK. I chose to write my thesis back in Budapest just in time for the start of the pandemic.Entering the job market as a fresh graduate in the summer of 2020 was daunting but myself and my partner were fortunate enough to both find PhD positions in ZÃ¼rich. What really drew me to my position was that I would be working as part of a research project funded by the Federal Government with applied outcomes for environmental protection in Switzerland. Two years on and I can safely say that it was one of the best decisions I have made, I am part of a supportive research group with an inspiring supervisor and have the opportunity to mentor and pass on knowledge to others.<div id="fading-image">
