I thought I would share a little bit more about how I've arrived at doing what I do as my route towards starting a PhD was somewhat unconventional.

After my Bachelors degree, I spent 5 years working in what I would loosely call 'practical conservation'. First for a charity called The Conservation Volunteers in Scotland, leading groups of volunteers in a range of projects from Peatland restoration and woodland management, to constructing gardens in schools. Then for several years with a small eco-tourism, conservation and community development NGO, Elephant Livelihood Initiative Environment, in North-Eastern Cambodia.

In Cambodia, I saw the challenges of implementing conservation programs in protected areas and was really motivated to move towards a career in conservation practice. This led to short periods of work with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).

Between 2018-2020, I undertook an Erasmus Mundus 2-year Masters program in Environmental Science Policy and Management. Starting in Budapest for before relocating to the island of Lesvos in Greece and then Manchester in the UK. Finally I chose to write my thesis back in Budapest just in time for the start of the pandemic.

Freshly graduated myself and my partner were fortunate enough to both find PhD positions in ZÃ¼rich. What really drew me to my position was that I would be working as part of a research project with applied outcomes for environmental protection in Switzerland. Two years on and I can safely say that it was one of the best decisions I have made!
