However, it is worth noting that there may be discrepancies between departments and as such you should check the requirements for your department (My thesis was under D-BAUG).\nI built this template based upon the quarto-phd-thesis template from james-d-h: https://github.com/james-d-h/quarto-phd-thesis, adding some notable features.\nThe template is geared towards producing PDF output as I would imagine this is the most common format that theses must be submitted in.\nHere is the example produced by the template for you to view: Example PDF"

    "text": "🛠️ Customization\n\nPackage loading\nI use the .Rprofile to load R packages rather than specifying packages within individual .qmd files or .R scripts as the .Rprofile is called prior to rendering each file. Add any additional packages you require here.\n\n#load packages\npacks&lt;-c(\"ggplot2\", \"knitr\", \"kableExtra\", \"ggthemes\", \"stringr\")\n\n# Load required packages\ninvisible(lapply(packs, require, character.only = TRUE))\n\n\n\nUnified table and figure theming\nAlso in the .Rprofile are some functions to streamline uniform styling of figures and tables throughout your document\nFor tables the thesis_tbl() function sets options for knitr::kbl() and kableExtra::kable_styling() to produce booktabs style tables, with center aligned content and bold column titles:\n\nthesis_tbl &lt;- function(x, escape, ltable = FALSE) {\n  x %&gt;%\n    kbl(digits = 3,\n        align = \"c\",\n        booktabs = T,\n        format = \"latex\",\n        longtable = ltable,\n        escape = escape) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE,\n                  font_size = 10,\n                  # latex_options = c(\"hold_position\")\n                  )%&gt;%\n    column_spec(1:ncol(x),\n                latex_valign = \"t\") %&gt;%\n    row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %&gt;%\n    asis_output()\n}\n\nAn example of applying this function is included in chapters/paper-01-qmd:\n\n#load csv of allocation parameter summary statistics\nCalibration_summary &lt;- read.csv(\"chapters/paper-01/data/Validation_summary.csv\")\n\n#replace . in column names with white space\ncolnames(Calibration_summary) &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames(Calibration_summary), \"\\\\.\", \" \")\n\n#output as markdown table with Knitr::kable\n#knitr::kable(Calibration_summary, align=rep('c', ncol(LULC_agg_summary)), format = \"markdown\")\nCalibration_summary %&gt;% \n  thesis_tbl(escape = FALSE)\n\nFor figures the function theme_publication() sets a custom ggplot2 theme:\n\n#' theme_publication\n#' \n#' custom ggplot2 theme to apply to all plots\n#' \n#' @param base_size numeric base font size\n#' @param base_family character base font family\n#' @return ggplot2 theme\n#' @export\n\ntheme_thesis &lt;- function(\n    base_size=14,\n    base_family=\"Fira Sans\"\n) {\n  (theme_foundation(\n    base_size=base_size,\n    base_family=base_family)+\n     theme(\n       plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = rel(1.2),hjust = 0.5),\n       text = element_text(),\n       panel.background = element_rect(colour = NA),\n       plot.background = element_rect(colour = NA),\n       panel.border = element_rect(colour = NA),\n       axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = rel(0.8)),\n       axis.title.y = element_text(angle=90,vjust =2),\n       axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -0.2),\n       axis.text = element_text(), \n       axis.line = element_line(colour=\"black\"),\n       axis.ticks = element_line(),\n       panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n       panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n       legend.key = element_rect(colour = NA),\n       legend.position = \"bottom\",\n       legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n       legend.key.size= unit(0.2, \"cm\"),\n       legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\",\n                                   hjust=0.5),\n       plot.margin=unit(c(10,5,5,5),\"mm\"),\n       strip.background=element_rect(colour=\"#f0f0f0\",fill=\"#f0f0f0\"),\n       strip.text = element_text(face=\"bold\")\n     )\n  )\n}\n\nIn addition the .Rprofile contains a series of functions for producing custom continuous and discrete color palettes with the base set of colors specified within the function thesis_color():\n\nthesis_color &lt;- function(...) {\n  \n  thesis_colors &lt;- c(\n  'Seafoam' = \"#86B4A4\", \n  'Beigetan' =  \"#AC9E7C\",\n  'Lightgreen' =    \"#8D9973\",\n  'Olivegreen' =    \"#4F5838\",\n  'Forestgreen' =   \"#2D4631\",\n  'Emeraldgreen' =  \"#20342B\",\n  'Bluegreen' = \"#1C2D27\",\n  'Brown' = \"#413328\",\n  'Redbrown' =  \"#4E3028\",\n  'Rust' =  \"#8A341F\",\n  'Terracotta' =    \"#A96524\",\n  'Orange' =    \"#C06F2E\",\n  'Beige' = \"#D0A26E\",\n  'Paleorange' =    \"#D69D68\",\n  'Bone' =  \"#F6E3C2\",\n  'Tan' =   \"#BDA776\",\n  'Mustard' =   \"#B77D2B\",\n  'Ochre' = \"#9A792E\"\n  )\n  \n  cols &lt;- c(...)\n  \n  if (is.null(cols))\n    return (thesis_colors)\n  \n  thesis_colors[cols]\n}\n\nThese color palettes can be applied using defined ggplot2::scale_color_* and ggplot2::scale_fill_* methods. An example of applying the theme_thesis() and scale_color_thesis() functions is provided in chapters/paper-01/paper-01-figs.R:\n\np &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Fuel Efficiency vs. Car Weight\",\n    x = \"Weight (1000 lbs)\",\n    y = \"Miles per Gallon\",\n    color = \"Cylinders\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_thesis(palette = \"test_pal\")+\n  theme_thesis()\n\n\n\nCover page\nThe template allows you to add a coverpage using the quarto_titlepages extension. The cover page YAML options are set in in index.qmd:\n\n---\nformat: \n  pdf:\n    coverpage: true\n    coverpage-bg-image: \"frontmatter/images/cover_background.png\"\n    coverpage-title: \"Title\"\n    coverpage-footer: \"Subtitle\"\n    coverpage-theme:\n      title-fontfamily: \"FiraSans-Bold.ttf\"\n      title-fontsize: 24\n      title-color: mydarkgreen\n      title-align: \"right\"\n      title-bottom: \"27cm\"\n      title-width: \"20cm\"\n      title-left: \"18cm\"\n      header-style: \"none\"\n      footer-style: \"plain\"\n      footer-fontfamily: \"FiraSans-Regular.ttf\"\n      footer-bottom: \"25cm\"\n      footer-align: \"right\"\n      footer-width: \"20cm\"\n      footer-left: \"18cm\"\n      footer-fontsize: 20\n      footer-color: mydarkgreen\n      date-style: \"none\"\n      bg-image-fading: \"north\"\n      bg-image-opacity: 0.8\n---\n\nHere I have set the title and subtitle using the extension options but you could just as easily include these manually within your background image. For the details of all the YAML options see the guide for the quarto_titlepages extension:\n\n\nFront matter\n\nTranslated Summary\nThe ETH doctoral regulations stipulate that the thesis must include a translation of the summary or abstract into one of the Swiss national languages (following the English version). I have added a seperate .qmd file to include this and YAML key for specifying the translation of summary in _quarto.yml:\n\n---\nsummarytitle: Zusammenfassung\n---\n\n\n\nETH Zurich title page\nTo create the standard ETH title page for thesis I have adapted an existing LaTeX template with the relevant lines included in ETH-thesis-template.cls. Rather than directly editing the LaTeX I have defined YAML keys in partials/title.tex so that the fields can be filled directly in _quarto.yml:\n\n---\ntitlepage-title: \"Your thesis title\"\ntitlepage-author: \"Jane Doe\"\nsummarytitle: Zusammenfassung\ndegree: DOCTOR OF SCIENCES # Degree title \ndegreedate: 2025 # Year of degree submission\ndissnumber: XXXX # ETH dissertation number\ncitizenship: My home country # Country of citizenship\ndob: September 14, 1993 # Date of birth\nMSctitle: Environmental Policy, Science and Management # Title of MSc dgree\nMScuni: Central European University, University of Manchester, University of Lund, University of the Aegean # University/ies of MSc degree\nexaminer: Prof. Dr. Dwayne Johnson # Your examiner (title and name: Prof. Dr. X)\ncoexaminerone: Prof. Dr. Stevie Irwin # Your 1st co-examiner (title and name: Prof. Dr. X)\ncoexaminertwo: Dr. Brian Gumble # Your 2nd co-examiner (title and name: Prof. Dr. X)\n---\n\nWhich results in the title page being rendered as:\n\n\n\nRendered ETH title page\n\n\n\n\n\nChapters\nIn the template I have included typical chapters such as the Introduction, State of the Art, Structure, Synthesis and an example of chapter based on a published paper (chapters/paper-01-qmd). Each chapter is a separate .qmd file and you can include/exclude them, or add additional chapters, using the chapters YAML key in _quarto.yml:\n\nbook: \n  date: last-modified\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd # Used to enter the cover page yaml, glossary, abbreviations, etc.\n    - chapters/introduction/introduction.qmd\n    - chapters/sota/sota.qmd\n    - chapters/structure/structure.qmd\n    - chapters/paper-01/paper-01.qmd\n    - chapters/synthesis/synthesis.qmd\n    - endmatter/references.qmd\n    - endmatter/appendices.qmd\n    - endmatter/CV.qmd\n\nI have given each chapter a nested sub-directory in order to organize all of the content related to it but this is a personal stylistic decision. However, note that index.qmd, which includes the gloassary must be at the root of the project.\n\nPaper-based chapters\nFor cumulative paper theses the ETH regulations state that the chapters that represent published papers should include relevant details of the original article such as a full citation, date of publication, author contributions highlights and statement regarding any chages to the content.\nTo display this information along with some other details like links to research code and data, I use custom Quarto Callout Blocks at the start of each chapters .qmd:\n\n\n\nCallout block for article details\n\n\nThe code for this is included in chapters/paper-01/paper-01.qmd and it uses the LaTeX latex-credits package to produce the visualization of the author CRediT roles (Note this package is not available via CTAN so is included directly with the template LaTeX_pkgs/credits.sty).\n\n\nUpdating/including figures\nMy preferred method of preparing figures for Quarto documents is to produce and save them via dedicated R scripts rather than directly within the .qmd files themselves. This R script is then sourced directly at the head of the respective .qmd file to ensure the most up to date figures are used and the images are then included for each figure as in paper-01.qmd:\n\n#source the script that prepares all the figures\nsource(\"chapters/paper-01/paper-01-figs.R\")\n\n![Dummy figure](figures/dummy_plot.png){#fig-dummy} \n\nI do this because I find that when I have multiple figures with quite lengthy code it can make navigating the document a bit annoying. Again, this is a stylistic choice and you should feel free to include figure code directly within the .qmd’s.\n\n\n\nEnd matter\n\nReferences\nendmatter/references.qmd places a div to ensure that all references for all chapters are placed in this section:\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\n\nAppendices\nI have elected to have all appendices for each chapter be placed together after the reference list rather than after their respective chapters. As far I know the ETH regulations are ambiguous as to which of these options is preferred but given that I tend to have have long appendices this was preferable for me.\nI have also chosen to use Alpha-numeric (e.g. A.1) section numbering for the appendices which is specified at the head of endmatter/appendices.qmd before the .qmd files for the individual appendices for each chapter are sourced in sequence. Note: if you add additional chapters you will need to add lines to source the appendices in endmatter/appendices.qmd.\n\n\nCurriculum vitae\nThe ETH regulations require that you include your curriculum vitae at the end of your thesis, CV.qmd uses the LaTeX command \\includepdf[pages=-]{} to add in your CV from a provided .pdf."
