    "section": "",
    "text": "I have been a big fan of R for everything research related for several years and Rstudio has been my go-to IDE all the way from being a complete beginner to my current level which I would still only describe as ‘somewhat proficient’. So you can imagine that when Posit, the company behind Rstudio released their open-source technical publishing software, Quarto, I was naturally intrigued. Over the last year I’ve gotten really into Quarto and used it for all sorts of purposes: I made this website for myself along with several others, I’ve written a whole academic paper with it, produced a proposal and even used it to automate the mass-sending of invitation letters.\nThis experience prompted me to put together a workshop, that would try to combine all of the bits and pieces of useful knowledge I have acquired in using both R and Quarto for engaging in reproducible scientific research into a semi-coherent package.\nI submitted a proposal for the workshop to be delivered at the Landscape conference in Berlin in September 2024 and it was accepted. If you happen to be attending this conference you can sign up to attend the workshop in person but it wouldn’t be very FAIR (get it…) of me if I didn’t make the content freely available. So I created a dedicated website for it that also displays the content as a presentation at the same time (one of the other neat features of Quarto): https://blenback.github.io/R-for-Reproducible-Research/"

    "text": "I thought I would share a little bit more about how I’ve arrived at doing what I do as my route towards starting a PhD was somewhat unconventional.\nAfter my Bachelors degree, I spent 5 years working in what I would loosely call ‘practical conservation’. First for a charity called The Conservation Volunteers in Scotland, leading groups of volunteers in a range of projects from Peatland restoration and woodland management, to constructing gardens in schools. Then for several years with a small eco-tourism, conservation and community development NGO, Elephant Livelihood Initiative Environment, in North-Eastern Cambodia.\nIn Cambodia, I saw the challenges of implementing conservation programs in protected areas and was really motivated to move towards a career in conservation practice. This led to short periods of work with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).\nBetween 2018-2020, I undertook an Erasmus Mundus 2-year Masters program in Environmental Science Policy and Management. Starting in Budapest for before relocating to the island of Lesvos in Greece and then Manchester in the UK. Finally, I chose to write my thesis back in Budapest just in time for the start of the pandemic.\nFreshly graduated I was fortunate enough find a PhD position in Zürich. What really drew me to my position was that I would be working as part of a research project with applied outcomes for environmental protection in Switzerland. Two years on and I can safely say that it was one of the best decisions I have made!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "If you are like me, you only ever find yourself updating your CV when you are actually unemployed and looking for a new job. This is also a task I find especially time-consuming given that you end up chopping and changing what is included based upon different applications which inevitably leads to endlessly messing around with the formatting to keep things neat. I also don’t have much sense for design, and in fact the format of my previous CV was very kindly made for me by my partner.\nHowever, recently I found myself needing an up to date CV to share with project funders and so I thought it was time to invest in a new format and try to mitigate some of the headaches of updating the content in the future.\nI knew I wanted a more modern format, complete with social links, a picture and a more bold design so I opted for the pagedown::html_resume format which I adapted from the updates made by Mickaël Canouil (who is always doing cool Quarto projects).\nSome nerdy features about this format/approach that I like:\n\nAlthough it is rendered with Rmarkdown, the raw inputs for most of the sections are entered directly in a simple Excel file.\nThe publications are read from a Bibtex. file which I can keep updated using Zotero (my academic library software of choice).\nThe document is rebuilt automatically every time it is committed to the remote git repo using a github action\nIt renders as both HTML and PDF simultaneously\nI can apply other templates and easily control which sections are included when applications require different types of CVs\n\nI added some personal touches to make it my own, including additional, academia relevant, social links to the side bar such as ResearchGate and ORCID, as well as a languages section. I also wrote some code to utilise custom entries within my bibtex file to add different links to entries. For example, links to the slides for my presentations (hosted here on my website), the papers and code for my publications and project-specific websites I have created. Here is the final result:\n\n  \n\nand if you want to do do something similar here is the github repo"

Of course, also drawing upon the definition of nascent in terms of something begin to grow or change.\nThis is the first project for which I wrote the proposal and it was funded through the Biodiversity and Ecosystem services scenario modelling challenge put together by SwissRE. I will work on this project until 2025, continuing in the chair of Planning of Landscape and Urban Systems under Prof. Dr. Adrienne Gret-Regamy at ETH Zurich.\nWe have already put together a multi-lingual website for the project where we hope to communicate the process and results of the research to a more diverse audience than just through journal articles. To this end we have also created LinkedIn and Facebook pages to help spread the word so please follow them if you use these platforms!"

    "text": "At the World Biodiversity Forum in Davos, Switzerland, I had the pleasure of presenting early results of the NASCENT-Peru scenario creation workshops that took place in May and June 2024.\nThis was a great opportunity to showcase the project to researchers from around the world and highlight the importance of scenarios depicting positive futures for landscape development from the perspective of local stakeholders.\nWe also had the opportunity to meet with the teams of the other projects funded by SwissRE who are doing similar work in different regions of the world. It was inspiring to see the diversity of approaches and goals that each project hopes to achieve.\nHere are some photos from the event and below you can access the presentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{black2024,\n  author = {Black, Benjamin},\n  title = {Normative Scenarios of Landscape Change for {Nature-Positive}\n    Futures in {Peru}},\n  date = {2024-06-20},\n  url = {https://blenback.github.io/presentations/2024_20_6_WBF/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBlack, Benjamin. 2024. “Normative Scenarios of Landscape Change\nfor Nature-Positive Futures in Peru.” June 20, 2024. https://blenback.github.io/presentations/2024_20_6_WBF/."

    "text": "In September, I had the pleasure of contributing a joint presentation, with colleagues from the ValPar.CH project, for the 4th Swiss Landscape Congress in Tramelan, Switzerland. This conference was fairly unique as it strived to bring together not just academics but also practice-oriented professionals and stakeholders from various fields related to the landscape in Switzerland. Our contribution,demonstrated how the different methods that we have employed in our research can offer insights into decision-making regarding the implementation of an ecological infrastructure in Switzerland that achieves it’s intended purpose of safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services whilst also being socially acceptable.\nBelow you can view the English version of our presentation:\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{black2024,\n  author = {Black, Benjamin},\n  title = {Negotiating Scenarios of a Desirable Ecological\n    Infrastructure for {Switzerland}},\n  date = {2024-09-05},\n  url = {https://blenback.github.io/presentations/2024_5_9_Landschaft/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBlack, Benjamin. 2024. “Negotiating Scenarios of a Desirable\nEcological Infrastructure for Switzerland.” September 5, 2024. https://blenback.github.io/presentations/2024_5_9_Landschaft/."

Also because the Github repository for it is public you can also see the source code that underlies it.
