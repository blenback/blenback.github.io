    "text": "I have been a big fan of R for everything research related for several years and Rstudio has been my go-to IDE all the way from being a complete beginner to my current level which I would still only describe as ‘somewhat proficient’. So you can imagine that when Posit, the company behind Rstudio released their open-source technical publishing software, Quarto, I was naturally intrigued. Over the last year I’ve gotten really into Quarto and used it for all sorts of purposes: I made this website for myself along with several others, I’ve written a whole academic paper with it, produced a proposal and even used it to automate the mass-sending of invitation letters.\nThis experience prompted me to put together a workshop, that would try to combine all of the bits and pieces of useful knowledge I have acquired in using both R and Quarto for engaging in reproducible scientific research into a semi-coherent package.\nI submitted a proposal for the workshop to be delivered at the Landscape conference in Berlin in September 2024 and it was accepted. If you happen to be attending this conference you can sign up to attend the workshop in person but it wouldn’t be very FAIR (get it…) of me if I didn’t make the content freely available. So I created a dedicated website for it that also displays the content as a presentation at the same time (one of the other neat features of Quarto): https://blenback.github.io/R-for-Reproducible-Research/"

    "text": "I thought I would share a little bit more about how I’ve arrived at doing what I do as my route towards starting a PhD was somewhat unconventional.\nAfter my Bachelors degree, I spent 5 years working in what I would loosely call ‘practical conservation’. First for a charity called The Conservation Volunteers in Scotland, leading groups of volunteers in a range of projects from Peatland restoration and woodland management, to constructing gardens in schools. Then for several years with a small eco-tourism, conservation and community development NGO, Elephant Livelihood Initiative Environment, in North-Eastern Cambodia.\nIn Cambodia, I saw the challenges of implementing conservation programs in protected areas and was really motivated to move towards a career in conservation practice. This led to short periods of work with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).\nBetween 2018-2020, I undertook an Erasmus Mundus 2-year Masters program in Environmental Science Policy and Management. Starting in Budapest for before relocating to the island of Lesvos in Greece and then Manchester in the UK. Finally, I chose to write my thesis back in Budapest just in time for the start of the pandemic.\nFreshly graduated I was fortunate enough find a PhD position in Zürich. What really drew me to my position was that I would be working as part of a research project with applied outcomes for environmental protection in Switzerland. Two years on and I can safely say that it was one of the best decisions I have made!"

    "text": "If you are like me, you only ever find yourself updating your CV when you are actually unemployed and looking for a new job. This is also a task I find especially time-consuming given that you end up chopping and changing what is included based upon different applications which inevitably leads to endlessly messing around with the formatting to keep things neat. I also don’t have much sense for design, and in fact the format of my previous CV was very kindly made for me by my partner.\nHowever, recently I found myself needing an up to date CV to share with project funders and so I thought it was time to invest in a new format and try to mitigate some of the headaches of updating the content in the future.\nI knew I wanted a more modern format, complete with social links, a picture and a more bold design so I opted for the pagedown::html_resume format which I adapted from the updates made by Mickaël Canouil (who is always doing cool Quarto projects).\nSome nerdy features about this format/approach that I like:\n\nAlthough it is rendered with Rmarkdown, the raw inputs for most of the sections are entered directly in a simple Excel file.\nThe publications are read from a Bibtex. file which I can keep updated using Zotero (my academic library software of choice).\nThe document is rebuilt automatically every time it is committed to the remote git repo using a github action\nIt renders as both HTML and PDF simultaneously\nI can apply other templates and easily control which sections are included when applications require different types of CVs\n\nI added some personal touches to make it my own, including additional, academia relevant, social links to the side bar such as ResearchGate and ORCID, as well as a languages section. I also wrote some code to utilise custom entries within my bibtex file to add different links to entries. For example, links to the slides for my presentations (hosted here on my website), the papers and code for my publications and project-specific websites I have created. Here is the final result:\n\n  \n\nand if you want to do do something similar here is the github repo"

Of course, also drawing upon the definition of nascent in terms of something begin to grow or change.\nThis is the first project for which I wrote the proposal and it was funded through the Biodiversity and Ecosystem services scenario modelling challenge put together by SwissRE. I will work on this project until 2025, continuing in the chair of Planning of Landscape and Urban Systems under Prof. Dr. Adrienne Gret-Regamy at ETH Zurich.\nWe have already put together a multi-lingual website for the project where we hope to communicate the process and results of the research to a more diverse audience than just through journal articles. To this end we have also created LinkedIn and Facebook pages to help spread the word so please follow them if you use these platforms!"

They used a sophisticated spatial simulation model to test how different choices might shape the landscape between 2020 and 2060.\n\n\n\n\n  🔍 Key Findings\n  \n    Normative scenarios led to more sustainable landscapes compared to business-as-usual or worst-case scenarios.\n    Urban expansion and landscape fragmentation were much higher in exploratory scenarios.\n    Protected area expansion and land use zoning helped maintain ecological connectivity and reduce sprawl.\n    Expert feedback was mixed: while useful, users found it hard to engage with highly detailed simulation maps.\n    Key challenge: making spatial simulation results easily interpretable for strategic decision-making.\n  \n\n\n\n  🧪 Methods\n  \n    Five future scenarios were simulated using a Land Use and Land Cover Change - Constrained Cellular Automata (LULCC-CCA) model.\n    Inputs were derived from expert workshops, demographic projections, climate models, and economic data.\n    Each scenario was defined by different values and goals, aligned with the IPBES “Nature Futures Framework.”\n    Scenario elements included:\n      \n      Dynamic climate and population drivers\n      Land use transition rules and probabilities\n      Spatial interventions like zoning and protected areas\n    \n  \n  Model validation included comparison with historical land use and feedback from experts via an interactive web platform.\n\n\n\n\n  🌱 Implications\n  \n    Normative scenarios support sustainability: This approach can help plan land use that protects biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n    Participatory modelling is essential: Combining expert and stakeholder input ensures models reflect diverse values.\n    Better communication tools are needed: To involve more people in decision-making, simulation results must be clearer and more accessible.\n    Future planning can benefit from scenario modelling by identifying trade-offs and synergies before decisions are made.\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n    \n      Data \n    \n    \n      Code \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Wicki, S., Black, B., Kurmann, M., Grêt-Regamey, A. \n    2023\n    Archetypes of social-ecological-technological systems for managing ecological infrastructure. \n    Environ.

Using Geneva, Switzerland as a case study, we applied a systems-based approach \n  combining social, ecological, and technological data to create spatial archetypes. These archetypes help identify how \n  different types of landscapes function and what strategies might work best to support nature and human well-being.\n\n\n\n\n🔍 Key Findings\n\n  Seven distinct landscape archetypes were identified across Geneva, such as “Concrete Jungle” and “Green Frontier.”\n  There is a strong disconnect between ecological conditions and social/technological systems in dense urban areas.\n  Some archetypes (e.g., Cultivated Oasis) offer high ecological benefits and biodiversity, while others (e.g., Concrete Jungle) are underperforming ecologically.\n  Tailored management strategies are needed for each archetype, considering their social and ecological roles.\n  Stakeholders emphasized the importance of collaboration, incentives, and spatial planning to implement EI effectively.\n\n\n\n\n🧪 Methods\n\n  Used a Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS) framework with high-resolution spatial data (25m grid).\n  Gathered data on biodiversity, infrastructure, demographics, and ecosystem services (Nature’s Contributions to People).\n  Applied machine learning (PCA and clustering) to group Geneva’s landscape into 7 archetypes based on SETS variables.\n  Engaged stakeholders in interviews and workshops to validate data and develop policy recommendations per archetype.\n  Mapped current and projected land use change (to 2060) to understand potential pressures and trends.\n\n\n\n\n🌱 Implications\n\n  Local strategies for diverse areas: Each archetype needs context-specific management approaches.\n  Integrated planning is key:

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.105574\n    \n    \n    \n     Plain Langauge Summary \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n  📝 Overview\n  \n  This study explores how land use and land cover change (LULCC) is predicted using models called cellular automata. \n  Typically, models are only evaluated after they simulate changes, but this paper shows that checking the predictions \n  earlier in the process—called stage 1 validation—can make models more accurate and easier to understand.\n\n\n\n\n  🔍 Key Findings\n  \n    Stage 1 validation improves transparency: Early checks reveal problems hidden in final map-only evaluations.\n    Not all transition models perform equally: Some predictions were unreliable despite using advanced methods.\n    Individual model checks help: Looking at transitions separately exposes weak areas like data imbalance.\n    Predictor selection improves models: Removing unnecessary inputs improved performance, especially for logistic regression.\n    Random Forests generally outperformed Logistic Regression, but were less sensitive to input refinement.\n  \n\n\n\n🧪 Methods\n\n  Study Area: Land cover transitions across Switzerland from 2009 to 2018 were analyzed.\n  Data: Swiss national land use datasets were combined with environmental and spatial predictors (e.g., elevation, soil, roads).\n  Models: Transition potential (TP) models were built using Logistic Regression and Random Forests for 174 specific land change scenarios.\n  Validation: \n    \n      Stage 1 validation: Assessed how well TP models predicted transition probabilities before simulation.\n      Stage 2 validation: Compared simulated maps to observed maps (used less in this study).\n    \n  \n  Performance Metrics: ROC AUC and Boyce Index were used to evaluate model accuracy and generalizability.\n  Variable Selection: A two-step method reduced redundant predictors, tested for model performance and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n  🌱 Implications\n  \n    More efficient calibration: Stage 1 saves time by avoiding full simulations for every tweak.\n    Improved interpretability: Helps users understand and trust predictions, important for policy-making.\n    Need for better tools: A shared calibration protocol would benefit land change modelling broadly.\n    Supports sustainable planning: Better models mean better decisions for urban growth, agriculture, and nature.\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n      Preprint \n    \n    \n    \n      Code \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Black, B., Anthony, B.P. \n

Conservation\n    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02228\n    \n    \n    \n     Plain Langauge Summary \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n  \n  📝 Overview\n  Forests play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by storing \n  carbon, supporting biodiversity, and regulating climate patterns. However,\n  rapid deforestation—caused by agriculture, infrastructure development, \n  and illegal logging—poses a significant threat to these ecosystems. \n  To counteract this issue, governments and conservation organizations have\n  established protected areas (PAs), which are designated regions where land\n  use is restricted to prevent forest loss. While these areas are intended \n  to preserve forests, their effectiveness is often uncertain. \n  This study aims to evaluate whether Cambodia’s protected areas have\n  successfully reduced deforestation and to what extent they contribute\n  to conservation efforts.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  🔍 Key Findings\n  \n      Protected areas have had a measurable impact on reducing deforestation, but their success varies widely based on location, enforcement, and external pressures.\n      Some PAs significantly reduced deforestation, particularly those with strong legal enforcement and active management strategies.\n      Many PAs located in high-risk areas (e.g., near expanding agricultural zones and infrastructure projects) were more effective than those in remote, less-threatened regions.            \n      Despite legal protection, deforestation still occurred within some PAs, often due to weak enforcement, illegal logging, or encroachment for agricultural use.\n      The study also found that some PAs were established in areas where deforestation risk was already low, making their protective impact appear greater than it actually was.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  🧪 Methods\n    Rather than simply comparing protected forests to unprotected ones, \n    this research employed a method known as counterfactual analysis.\n    This technique helps estimate what would have happened if no protections had been put in place. \n    By doing so, the study provides a more accurate assessment of the real impact of protected areas.\n    Without using this approach, it is difficult to determine whether a protected \n    forest remains intact because of conservation policies or simply because \n    it was never at high risk of deforestation.\n    To conduct this analysis, satellite imagery and deforestation data \n    were examined across different regions in Cambodia. Various factors were\n    considered, including land-use policies, road proximity, human population density,\n    and historical deforestation trends. By comparing observed deforestation within PAs \n    to a predicted scenario without protections, the study was able to isolate the true impact of conservation efforts.\n    \n    \n  \n\n  🌱 Implications\n      \n    \n     Understanding how well protected areas function is critical for improving\n    conservation strategies. If some PAs are not successfully reducing deforestation,\n    it may indicate a need for better enforcement, improved land management policies,\n    or the establishment of protection in higher-risk areas.\n     This study highlights the importance of using data-driven approaches to\n    evaluate conservation outcomes and ensure that resources are directed\n    toward efforts that have the greatest impact.\n     By refining the selection \n    and management of protected areas, policymakers and conservationists can\n    enhance their effectiveness, ensuring that Cambodia’s forests continue\n    to provide ecological, economic, and social benefits for future generations.\n     This research underscores the need for scientific assessments in\n    conservation planning. By continually monitoring and adapting conservation policies\n    based on evidence, we can create more effective strategies to combat\n    deforestation and preserve Cambodia’s rich forest ecosystems.\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n    \n    \n      Code \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\nTheses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Black, B. \n    \n    Identifying effective area-based conservation strategies under uncertainty \n    Doctoral thesis.
