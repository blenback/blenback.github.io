However, it is worth noting that there may be discrepancies between departments and as such you should check the requirements for your department (My thesis was under D-BAUG).\nI built this template based upon the quarto-phd-thesis template from james-d-h: https://github.com/james-d-h/quarto-phd-thesis, adding some notable features.\nThe template is geared towards producing PDF output as I would imagine this is the most common format that theses must be submitted in.\nHere is the example produced by the template for you to view: Example PDF"

    "text": "🛠️ Customization\n\nPackage loading\nI use the .Rprofile to load R packages rather than specifying packages within individual .qmd files or .R scripts as the .Rprofile is called prior to rendering each file. Add any additional packages you require here.\n\n#load packages\npacks&lt;-c(\"ggplot2\", \"knitr\", \"kableExtra\", \"ggthemes\", \"stringr\")\n\n# Load required packages\ninvisible(lapply(packs, require, character.only = TRUE))\n\n\n\nUnified table and figure theming\nAlso in the .Rprofile are some functions to streamline uniform styling of figures and tables throughout your document\nFor tables the thesis_tbl() function sets options for knitr::kbl() and kableExtra::kable_styling() to produce booktabs style tables, with center aligned content and bold column titles:\n\nthesis_tbl &lt;- function(x, escape, ltable = FALSE) {\n  x %&gt;%\n    kbl(digits = 3,\n        align = \"c\",\n        booktabs = T,\n        format = \"latex\",\n        longtable = ltable,\n        escape = escape) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(full_width = FALSE,\n                  font_size = 10,\n                  # latex_options = c(\"hold_position\")\n                  )%&gt;%\n    column_spec(1:ncol(x),\n                latex_valign = \"t\") %&gt;%\n    row_spec(0, bold=TRUE) %&gt;%\n    asis_output()\n}\n\nAn example of applying this function is included in chapters/paper-01-qmd:\n\n#load csv of allocation parameter summary statistics\nCalibration_summary &lt;- read.csv(\"chapters/paper-01/data/Validation_summary.csv\")\n\n#replace . in column names with white space\ncolnames(Calibration_summary) &lt;- str_replace_all(colnames(Calibration_summary), \"\\\\.\", \" \")\n\n#output as markdown table with Knitr::kable\n#knitr::kable(Calibration_summary, align=rep('c', ncol(LULC_agg_summary)), format = \"markdown\")\nCalibration_summary %&gt;% \n  thesis_tbl(escape = FALSE)\n\nFor figures the function theme_publication() sets a custom ggplot2 theme:\n\n#' theme_publication\n#' \n#' custom ggplot2 theme to apply to all plots\n#' \n#' @param base_size numeric base font size\n#' @param base_family character base font family\n#' @return ggplot2 theme\n#' @export\n\ntheme_thesis &lt;- function(\n    base_size=14,\n    base_family=\"Fira Sans\"\n) {\n  (theme_foundation(\n    base_size=base_size,\n    base_family=base_family)+\n     theme(\n       plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = rel(1.2),hjust = 0.5),\n       text = element_text(),\n       panel.background = element_rect(colour = NA),\n       plot.background = element_rect(colour = NA),\n       panel.border = element_rect(colour = NA),\n       axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = rel(0.8)),\n       axis.title.y = element_text(angle=90,vjust =2),\n       axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -0.2),\n       axis.text = element_text(), \n       axis.line = element_line(colour=\"black\"),\n       axis.ticks = element_line(),\n       panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n       panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n       legend.key = element_rect(colour = NA),\n       legend.position = \"bottom\",\n       legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n       legend.key.size= unit(0.2, \"cm\"),\n       legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\",\n                                   hjust=0.5),\n       plot.margin=unit(c(10,5,5,5),\"mm\"),\n       strip.background=element_rect(colour=\"#f0f0f0\",fill=\"#f0f0f0\"),\n       strip.text = element_text(face=\"bold\")\n     )\n  )\n}\n\nIn addition the .Rprofile contains a series of functions for producing custom continuous and discrete color palettes with the base set of colors specified within the function thesis_color():\n\nthesis_color &lt;- function(...) {\n  \n  thesis_colors &lt;- c(\n  'Seafoam' = \"#86B4A4\", \n  'Beigetan' =  \"#AC9E7C\",\n  'Lightgreen' =    \"#8D9973\",\n  'Olivegreen' =    \"#4F5838\",\n  'Forestgreen' =   \"#2D4631\",\n  'Emeraldgreen' =  \"#20342B\",\n  'Bluegreen' = \"#1C2D27\",\n  'Brown' = \"#413328\",\n  'Redbrown' =  \"#4E3028\",\n  'Rust' =  \"#8A341F\",\n  'Terracotta' =    \"#A96524\",\n  'Orange' =    \"#C06F2E\",\n  'Beige' = \"#D0A26E\",\n  'Paleorange' =    \"#D69D68\",\n  'Bone' =  \"#F6E3C2\",\n  'Tan' =   \"#BDA776\",\n  'Mustard' =   \"#B77D2B\",\n  'Ochre' = \"#9A792E\"\n  )\n  \n  cols &lt;- c(...)\n  \n  if (is.null(cols))\n    return (thesis_colors)\n  \n  thesis_colors[cols]\n}\n\nThese color palettes can be applied using defined ggplot2::scale_color_* and ggplot2::scale_fill_* methods. An example of applying the theme_thesis() and scale_color_thesis() functions is provided in chapters/paper-01/paper-01-figs.R:\n\np &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Fuel Efficiency vs. Car Weight\",\n    x = \"Weight (1000 lbs)\",\n    y = \"Miles per Gallon\",\n    color = \"Cylinders\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_thesis(palette = \"test_pal\")+\n  theme_thesis()\n\n\n\nCover page\nThe template allows you to add a coverpage using the quarto_titlepages extension. The cover page YAML options are set in in index.qmd:\n\n---\nformat: \n  pdf:\n    coverpage: true\n    coverpage-bg-image: \"frontmatter/images/cover_background.png\"\n    coverpage-title: \"Title\"\n    coverpage-footer: \"Subtitle\"\n    coverpage-theme:\n      title-fontfamily: \"FiraSans-Bold.ttf\"\n      title-fontsize: 24\n      title-color: mydarkgreen\n      title-align: \"right\"\n      title-bottom: \"27cm\"\n      title-width: \"20cm\"\n      title-left: \"18cm\"\n      header-style: \"none\"\n      footer-style: \"plain\"\n      footer-fontfamily: \"FiraSans-Regular.ttf\"\n      footer-bottom: \"25cm\"\n      footer-align: \"right\"\n      footer-width: \"20cm\"\n      footer-left: \"18cm\"\n      footer-fontsize: 20\n      footer-color: mydarkgreen\n      date-style: \"none\"\n      bg-image-fading: \"north\"\n      bg-image-opacity: 0.8\n---\n\nHere I have set the title and subtitle using the extension options but you could just as easily include these manually within your background image. For the details of all the YAML options see the guide for the quarto_titlepages extension:\n\n\nFront matter\n\nTranslated Summary\nThe ETH doctoral regulations stipulate that the thesis must include a translation of the summary or abstract into one of the Swiss national languages (following the English version). I have added a seperate .qmd file to include this and YAML key for specifying the translation of summary in _quarto.yml:\n\n---\nsummarytitle: Zusammenfassung\n---\n\n\n\nETH Zurich title page\nTo create the standard ETH title page for thesis I have adapted an existing LaTeX template with the relevant lines included in ETH-thesis-template.cls. Rather than directly editing the LaTeX I have defined YAML keys in partials/title.tex so that the fields can be filled directly in _quarto.yml:\n\n---\ntitlepage-title: \"Your thesis title\"\ntitlepage-author: \"Jane Doe\"\nsummarytitle: Zusammenfassung\ndegree: DOCTOR OF SCIENCES # Degree title \ndegreedate: 2025 # Year of degree submission\ndissnumber: XXXX # ETH dissertation number\ncitizenship: My home country # Country of citizenship\ndob: September 14, 1993 # Date of birth\nMSctitle: Environmental Policy, Science and Management # Title of MSc dgree\nMScuni: Central European University, University of Manchester, University of Lund, University of the Aegean # University/ies of MSc degree\nexaminer: Prof. Dr. Dwayne Johnson # Your examiner (title and name: Prof. Dr. X)\ncoexaminerone: Prof. Dr. Stevie Irwin # Your 1st co-examiner (title and name: Prof. Dr. X)\ncoexaminertwo: Dr. Brian Gumble # Your 2nd co-examiner (title and name: Prof. Dr. X)\n---\n\nWhich results in the title page being rendered as:\n\n\n\nRendered ETH title page\n\n\n\n\n\nChapters\nIn the template I have included typical chapters such as the Introduction, State of the Art, Structure, Synthesis and an example of chapter based on a published paper (chapters/paper-01-qmd). Each chapter is a separate .qmd file and you can include/exclude them, or add additional chapters, using the chapters YAML key in _quarto.yml:\n\nbook: \n  date: last-modified\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd # Used to enter the cover page yaml, glossary, abbreviations, etc.\n    - chapters/introduction/introduction.qmd\n    - chapters/sota/sota.qmd\n    - chapters/structure/structure.qmd\n    - chapters/paper-01/paper-01.qmd\n    - chapters/synthesis/synthesis.qmd\n    - endmatter/references.qmd\n    - endmatter/appendices.qmd\n    - endmatter/CV.qmd\n\nI have given each chapter a nested sub-directory in order to organize all of the content related to it but this is a personal stylistic decision. However, note that index.qmd, which includes the gloassary must be at the root of the project.\n\nPaper-based chapters\nFor cumulative paper theses the ETH regulations state that the chapters that represent published papers should include relevant details of the original article such as a full citation, date of publication, author contributions highlights and statement regarding any chages to the content.\nTo display this information along with some other details like links to research code and data, I use custom Quarto Callout Blocks at the start of each chapters .qmd:\n\n\n\nCallout block for article details\n\n\nThe code for this is included in chapters/paper-01/paper-01.qmd and it uses the LaTeX latex-credits package to produce the visualization of the author CRediT roles (Note this package is not available via CTAN so is included directly with the template LaTeX_pkgs/credits.sty).\n\n\nUpdating/including figures\nMy preferred method of preparing figures for Quarto documents is to produce and save them via dedicated R scripts rather than directly within the .qmd files themselves. This R script is then sourced directly at the head of the respective .qmd file to ensure the most up to date figures are used and the images are then included for each figure as in paper-01.qmd:\n\n#source the script that prepares all the figures\nsource(\"chapters/paper-01/paper-01-figs.R\")\n\n![Dummy figure](figures/dummy_plot.png){#fig-dummy} \n\nI do this because I find that when I have multiple figures with quite lengthy code it can make navigating the document a bit annoying. Again, this is a stylistic choice and you should feel free to include figure code directly within the .qmd’s.\n\n\n\nEnd matter\n\nReferences\nendmatter/references.qmd places a div to ensure that all references for all chapters are placed in this section:\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\n\nAppendices\nI have elected to have all appendices for each chapter be placed together after the reference list rather than after their respective chapters. As far I know the ETH regulations are ambiguous as to which of these options is preferred but given that I tend to have have long appendices this was preferable for me.\nI have also chosen to use Alpha-numeric (e.g. A.1) section numbering for the appendices which is specified at the head of endmatter/appendices.qmd before the .qmd files for the individual appendices for each chapter are sourced in sequence. Note: if you add additional chapters you will need to add lines to source the appendices in endmatter/appendices.qmd.\n\n\nCurriculum vitae\nThe ETH regulations require that you include your curriculum vitae at the end of your thesis, CV.qmd uses the LaTeX command \\includepdf[pages=-]{} to add in your CV from a provided .pdf."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In October 2024 I attended a workshop on speeding up the development of useful agent-based land use models. This was a great opportunity for me to engage in a research field that overlaps my own but is still very different. One of the outcomes of the workshop was that we decided to try and compile a collection of useful educational resources for researchers and students working on the topic.\n\n\n\nI proposed that we do this in the form of an Awesome List, which in case you are not familiar is a curated list of resources on a specific topic, typically hosted on GitHub. The nice thing about this format is that it is easy to contribute to, and anyone can add resources they find useful. But at the same time the drawback is that the list is presented as the README section of the Github repository which is not so accessible for those not familiar with the service.\nTo get around this and display the list in a nicer format, I made an accompanying Quarto webpage for it, hosted through Github pages. But I didn’t want it to be a chore to maintain so I wrote an R script that splits the repo’s README.md file into sections and writes the contents to individual Quarto .qmd files for different types of content that are then brought together as a single page. This script is run automatically as a Github action every time there is a push to main branch of the repo so the webpage is kept up to date.\n\n\n\nThe list itself is still a work in progress but the repo can be viewed here: https://github.com/awesome-ABM-LU/awesome-ABM-LU and the webpage here: https://awesome-abm-lu.github.io/awesome-ABM-LU/"

    "title": "Creating my own PhD thesis template with Quarto",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Over the last two years I have really started to use Quarto for everything in my academic work from writing manuscripts, websites for research projects, data dashboards for workshops, chain letter writing, and presentations. So when it came to writing my PhD thesis I already knew I wanted to use Quarto.\nFor those not familiar with Quarto, some of the big advantages it offers for a project like this is the ability to include Python and R code chunks that are computed when the document is rendered. It also connects directly with my scientific literature tool of choice, Zotero, for easy compilation of the bibliography. Finally in terms of formatting it allows you to mix in Markdown, LaTeX and HTML.\nMy thesis is a cumulative paper thesis and I had already written two of my academic papers using Quarto so integrating these was as simple as copying over the relevant files. As for the other papers that had been written in Word these were very simple to convert to Markdown format, especially with the help of ChatGPT which I find to be very accurate for tasks.\nIn terms of an appropriate Quarto template, I found several existing examples:\n\nhttps://github.com/james-d-h/quarto-phd-thesis\nhttps://github.com/quarto-monash/thesis\nhttps://gongcastro.github.io/blog/upfthesis/upfthesis.html\nhttps://cameronpatrick.com/post/2023/07/quarto-thesis-formatting/#html-output\n\nHowever, none quite fit the specifications of my university (ETH Zurich) and my personal formatting preferences. So I decided to take the quarto-phd-thesis template from james-d-h and build upon it to make it my own. The main features I added were:\n\nThe ability to add a cover page using the quarto_titlepages extension\nCustom R functions to ensure consistent formatting of all figures and tables according to user specified color palettes.\nUse of .Rprofile to manage package loading across chapters\nThe ETH Zurich title page and a translated version of the summary into one of the Swiss national languages.\nCustom Quarto call-out boxes to display the details of published articles at the start of chapters including a visualization of author CRediT contributions.\nAdditional LaTeX formatting\n\nI have called the resulting template quarto-eth-phd-thesis and it is available via Github here: https://github.com/blenback/quarto-eth-phd-thesis. There is a detailed README in the repo but I have also written the instructions in page on my website: https://blenback.github.io/quarto-eth-phd-thesis.html\nHere is an example PDF showing some of the features:"

They used a sophisticated spatial simulation model to test how different choices might shape the landscape between 2020 and 2060.\n\n\n\n\n  🔍 Key Findings\n  \n    Normative scenarios led to more sustainable landscapes compared to business-as-usual or worst-case scenarios.\n    Urban expansion and landscape fragmentation were much higher in exploratory scenarios.\n    Protected area expansion and land use zoning helped maintain ecological connectivity and reduce sprawl.\n    Expert feedback was mixed: while useful, users found it hard to engage with highly detailed simulation maps.\n    Key challenge: making spatial simulation results easily interpretable for strategic decision-making.\n  \n\n\n\n  🧪 Methods\n  \n    Five future scenarios were simulated using a Land Use and Land Cover Change - Constrained Cellular Automata (LULCC-CCA) model.\n    Inputs were derived from expert workshops, demographic projections, climate models, and economic data.\n    Each scenario was defined by different values and goals, aligned with the IPBES “Nature Futures Framework.”\n    Scenario elements included:\n      \n      Dynamic climate and population drivers\n      Land use transition rules and probabilities\n      Spatial interventions like zoning and protected areas\n    \n  \n  Model validation included comparison with historical land use and feedback from experts via an interactive web platform.\n\n\n\n\n  🌱 Implications\n  \n    Normative scenarios support sustainability: This approach can help plan land use that protects biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n    Participatory modelling is essential: Combining expert and stakeholder input ensures models reflect diverse values.\n    Better communication tools are needed: To involve more people in decision-making, simulation results must be clearer and more accessible.\n    Future planning can benefit from scenario modelling by identifying trade-offs and synergies before decisions are made.\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n    \n      Data \n    \n    \n      Code \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Wicki, S., Black, B., Kurmann, M., Grêt-Regamey, A. \n    2023\n    Archetypes of social-ecological-technological systems for managing ecological infrastructure. \n    Environ.

Using Geneva, Switzerland as a case study, we applied a systems-based approach \n  combining social, ecological, and technological data to create spatial archetypes. These archetypes help identify how \n  different types of landscapes function and what strategies might work best to support nature and human well-being.\n\n\n\n\n🔍 Key Findings\n\n  Seven distinct landscape archetypes were identified across Geneva, such as “Concrete Jungle” and “Green Frontier.”\n  There is a strong disconnect between ecological conditions and social/technological systems in dense urban areas.\n  Some archetypes (e.g., Cultivated Oasis) offer high ecological benefits and biodiversity, while others (e.g., Concrete Jungle) are underperforming ecologically.\n  Tailored management strategies are needed for each archetype, considering their social and ecological roles.\n  Stakeholders emphasized the importance of collaboration, incentives, and spatial planning to implement EI effectively.\n\n\n\n\n🧪 Methods\n\n  Used a Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS) framework with high-resolution spatial data (25m grid).\n  Gathered data on biodiversity, infrastructure, demographics, and ecosystem services (Nature’s Contributions to People).\n  Applied machine learning (PCA and clustering) to group Geneva’s landscape into 7 archetypes based on SETS variables.\n  Engaged stakeholders in interviews and workshops to validate data and develop policy recommendations per archetype.\n  Mapped current and projected land use change (to 2060) to understand potential pressures and trends.\n\n\n\n\n🌱 Implications\n\n  Local strategies for diverse areas: Each archetype needs context-specific management approaches.\n  Integrated planning is key: Social and ecological systems must be aligned through smart design and regulation.\n  EI is not one-size-fits-all: Policies should reflect regional variation in land use and biodiversity potential.\n  Stakeholder engagement is essential: Co-producing knowledge ensures practical, accepted solutions.\n  Transferable approach: This archetype method can be applied to other urban regions worldwide to guide sustainable land use.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Black, B., Strien, M.J. van, Adde, A., Grêt-Regamey, A. \n    2022\n

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2022.105574\n    \n    \n    \n     Plain Langauge Summary \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n  📝 Overview\n  \n  This study explores how land use and land cover change (LULCC) is predicted using models called cellular automata. \n  Typically, models are only evaluated after they simulate changes, but this paper shows that checking the predictions \n  earlier in the process—called stage 1 validation—can make models more accurate and easier to understand.\n\n\n\n\n  🔍 Key Findings\n  \n    Stage 1 validation improves transparency: Early checks reveal problems hidden in final map-only evaluations.\n    Not all transition models perform equally: Some predictions were unreliable despite using advanced methods.\n    Individual model checks help: Looking at transitions separately exposes weak areas like data imbalance.\n    Predictor selection improves models: Removing unnecessary inputs improved performance, especially for logistic regression.\n    Random Forests generally outperformed Logistic Regression, but were less sensitive to input refinement.\n  \n\n\n\n🧪 Methods\n\n  Study Area: Land cover transitions across Switzerland from 2009 to 2018 were analyzed.\n  Data: Swiss national land use datasets were combined with environmental and spatial predictors (e.g., elevation, soil, roads).\n  Models: Transition potential (TP) models were built using Logistic Regression and Random Forests for 174 specific land change scenarios.\n  Validation: \n    \n      Stage 1 validation: Assessed how well TP models predicted transition probabilities before simulation.\n      Stage 2 validation: Compared simulated maps to observed maps (used less in this study).\n    \n  \n  Performance Metrics: ROC AUC and Boyce Index were used to evaluate model accuracy and generalizability.\n  Variable Selection: A two-step method reduced redundant predictors, tested for model performance and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n  🌱 Implications\n  \n    More efficient calibration: Stage 1 saves time by avoiding full simulations for every tweak.\n    Improved interpretability: Helps users understand and trust predictions, important for policy-making.\n    Need for better tools: A shared calibration protocol would benefit land change modelling broadly.\n    Supports sustainable planning: Better models mean better decisions for urban growth, agriculture, and nature.\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n      Preprint \n    \n    \n    \n      Code \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Black, B., Anthony, B.P. \n

Conservation\n    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02228\n    \n    \n    \n     Plain Langauge Summary \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n  \n  📝 Overview\n  Forests play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by storing \n  carbon, supporting biodiversity, and regulating climate patterns. However,\n  rapid deforestation—caused by agriculture, infrastructure development, \n  and illegal logging—poses a significant threat to these ecosystems. \n  To counteract this issue, governments and conservation organizations have\n  established protected areas (PAs), which are designated regions where land\n  use is restricted to prevent forest loss. While these areas are intended \n  to preserve forests, their effectiveness is often uncertain. \n  This study aims to evaluate whether Cambodia’s protected areas have\n  successfully reduced deforestation and to what extent they contribute\n  to conservation efforts.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  🔍 Key Findings\n  \n      Protected areas have had a measurable impact on reducing deforestation, but their success varies widely based on location, enforcement, and external pressures.\n      Some PAs significantly reduced deforestation, particularly those with strong legal enforcement and active management strategies.\n      Many PAs located in high-risk areas (e.g., near expanding agricultural zones and infrastructure projects) were more effective than those in remote, less-threatened regions.            \n      Despite legal protection, deforestation still occurred within some PAs, often due to weak enforcement, illegal logging, or encroachment for agricultural use.\n      The study also found that some PAs were established in areas where deforestation risk was already low, making their protective impact appear greater than it actually was.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  🧪 Methods\n    Rather than simply comparing protected forests to unprotected ones, \n    this research employed a method known as counterfactual analysis.\n    This technique helps estimate what would have happened if no protections had been put in place. \n    By doing so, the study provides a more accurate assessment of the real impact of protected areas.\n    Without using this approach, it is difficult to determine whether a protected \n    forest remains intact because of conservation policies or simply because \n    it was never at high risk of deforestation.\n    To conduct this analysis, satellite imagery and deforestation data \n    were examined across different regions in Cambodia. Various factors were\n    considered, including land-use policies, road proximity, human population density,\n    and historical deforestation trends. By comparing observed deforestation within PAs \n    to a predicted scenario without protections, the study was able to isolate the true impact of conservation efforts.\n    \n    \n  \n\n  🌱 Implications\n      \n    \n     Understanding how well protected areas function is critical for improving\n    conservation strategies. If some PAs are not successfully reducing deforestation,\n    it may indicate a need for better enforcement, improved land management policies,\n    or the establishment of protection in higher-risk areas.\n     This study highlights the importance of using data-driven approaches to\n    evaluate conservation outcomes and ensure that resources are directed\n    toward efforts that have the greatest impact.\n     By refining the selection \n    and management of protected areas, policymakers and conservationists can\n    enhance their effectiveness, ensuring that Cambodia’s forests continue\n    to provide ecological, economic, and social benefits for future generations.\n     This research underscores the need for scientific assessments in\n    conservation planning. By continually monitoring and adapting conservation policies\n    based on evidence, we can create more effective strategies to combat\n    deforestation and preserve Cambodia’s rich forest ecosystems.\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n    \n    \n      Code \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\nTheses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Black, B. \n    \n    Identifying effective area-based conservation strategies under uncertainty \n    Doctoral thesis.

    "text": "Scenario planning often qualitatively develops storylines. These scenarios are usually depicted in a 2 × 2 scenario matrix, where it is challenging to define, for example, the drivers of change to consider in the axes and the boundaries between scenarios. In this qualitative approach, simulation models are typically used as evaluation tools only after the scenarios are generated. This approach is commonly known in the literature as “Story and Simulation”.\nThis study introduces a “Scope, Simulation, and Story” approach, which has the potential to enhance scenario planning by informing the development of scenarios through computational modelling. Thus, we can integrate participatory processes, spatial development simulation models, and spatial analysis to define scenario boundaries that reflect spatial patterns. We applied this method to simulate spatial development in the Canton of Zurich for 2050 using a cellular automata Land Use Cover Change (LUCC) model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{black2025,\n  author = {Black, Ben and Roman, Orlando and Kwakkel, Jan and Adey,\n    Bryan and Black, Ben},\n  title = {A “{Scope,} {Simulation} and {Story}” Approach to Identify\n    Future Spatial Development Scenarios},\n  date = {2025-06-25},\n  url = {https://blenback.github.io/presentations/2025_25_6_CUPUM/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nBlack, Ben, Orlando Roman, Jan Kwakkel, Bryan Adey, and Ben Black. 2025.\n“A ‘Scope, Simulation and Story’ Approach to Identify\nFuture Spatial Development Scenarios.” June 25, 2025. https://blenback.github.io/presentations/2025_25_6_CUPUM/."

They used a sophisticated spatial simulation model to test how different choices might shape the landscape between 2020 and 2060.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Normative scenarios led to more sustainable landscapes compared to business-as-usual or worst-case scenarios.\n    Urban expansion and landscape fragmentation were much higher in exploratory scenarios.\n    Protected area expansion and land use zoning helped maintain ecological connectivity and reduce sprawl.\n    Expert feedback was mixed: while useful, users found it hard to engage with highly detailed simulation maps.\n    Key challenge: making spatial simulation results easily interpretable for strategic decision-making.\n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Five future scenarios were simulated using a Land Use and Land Cover Change - Constrained Cellular Automata (LULCC-CCA) model.\n    Inputs were derived from expert workshops, demographic projections, climate models, and economic data.\n    Each scenario was defined by different values and goals, aligned with the IPBES “Nature Futures Framework.”\n    Scenario elements included:\n      \n      Dynamic climate and population drivers\n      Land use transition rules and probabilities\n      Spatial interventions like zoning and protected areas\n    \n  \n  Model validation included comparison with historical land use and feedback from experts via an interactive web platform.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Normative scenarios support sustainability: This approach can help plan land use that protects biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n    Participatory modelling is essential: Combining expert and stakeholder input ensures models reflect diverse values.\n    Better communication tools are needed: To involve more people in decision-making, simulation results must be clearer and more accessible.\n    Future planning can benefit from scenario modelling by identifying trade-offs and synergies before decisions are made.\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n    \n      Data \n    \n    \n      Code \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Wicki, S., Black, B., Kurmann, M., Grêt-Regamey, A. \n    2023\n    Archetypes of social-ecological-technological systems for managing ecological infrastructure. \n    Environ.

Using Geneva, Switzerland as a case study, we applied a systems-based approach \n  combining social, ecological, and technological data to create spatial archetypes. These archetypes help identify how \n  different types of landscapes function and what strategies might work best to support nature and human well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Seven distinct landscape archetypes were identified across Geneva, such as “Concrete Jungle” and “Green Frontier.”\n  There is a strong disconnect between ecological conditions and social/technological systems in dense urban areas.\n  Some archetypes (e.g., Cultivated Oasis) offer high ecological benefits and biodiversity, while others (e.g., Concrete Jungle) are underperforming ecologically.\n  Tailored management strategies are needed for each archetype, considering their social and ecological roles.\n  Stakeholders emphasized the importance of collaboration, incentives, and spatial planning to implement EI effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Used a Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS) framework with high-resolution spatial data (25m grid).\n  Gathered data on biodiversity, infrastructure, demographics, and ecosystem services (Nature’s Contributions to People).\n  Applied machine learning (PCA and clustering) to group Geneva’s landscape into 7 archetypes based on SETS variables.\n  Engaged stakeholders in interviews and workshops to validate data and develop policy recommendations per archetype.\n  Mapped current and projected land use change (to 2060) to understand potential pressures and trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Local strategies for diverse areas: Each archetype needs context-specific management approaches.\n  Integrated planning is key: Social and ecological systems must be aligned through smart design and regulation.\n  EI is not one-size-fits-all: Policies should reflect regional variation in land use and biodiversity potential.\n  Stakeholder engagement is essential: Co-producing knowledge ensures practical, accepted solutions.\n  Transferable approach: This archetype method can be applied to other urban regions worldwide to guide sustainable land use.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Black, B., Strien, M.J. van, Adde, A., Grêt-Regamey, A. \n    2022\n    Re-considering the status quo:

\n    \n    \n     Plain Langauge Summary \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n  This study explores how land use and land cover change (LULCC) is predicted using models called cellular automata. \n  Typically, models are only evaluated after they simulate changes, but this paper shows that checking the predictions \n  earlier in the process—called stage 1 validation—can make models more accurate and easier to understand.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    Stage 1 validation improves transparency: Early checks reveal problems hidden in final map-only evaluations.\n    Not all transition models perform equally: Some predictions were unreliable despite using advanced methods.\n    Individual model checks help: Looking at transitions separately exposes weak areas like data imbalance.\n    Predictor selection improves models: Removing unnecessary inputs improved performance, especially for logistic regression.\n    Random Forests generally outperformed Logistic Regression, but were less sensitive to input refinement.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Study Area: Land cover transitions across Switzerland from 2009 to 2018 were analyzed.\n  Data: Swiss national land use datasets were combined with environmental and spatial predictors (e.g., elevation, soil, roads).\n  Models: Transition potential (TP) models were built using Logistic Regression and Random Forests for 174 specific land change scenarios.\n  Validation: \n    \n      Stage 1 validation: Assessed how well TP models predicted transition probabilities before simulation.\n      Stage 2 validation: Compared simulated maps to observed maps (used less in this study).\n    \n  \n  Performance Metrics: ROC AUC and Boyce Index were used to evaluate model accuracy and generalizability.\n  Variable Selection: A two-step method reduced redundant predictors, tested for model performance and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    More efficient calibration: Stage 1 saves time by avoiding full simulations for every tweak.\n    Improved interpretability: Helps users understand and trust predictions, important for policy-making.\n    Need for better tools: A shared calibration protocol would benefit land change modelling broadly.\n    Supports sustainable planning: Better models mean better decisions for urban growth, agriculture, and nature.\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n      Preprint \n    \n    \n

\n    \n\n  \n  \n  Forests play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by storing \n  carbon, supporting biodiversity, and regulating climate patterns. However,\n  rapid deforestation—caused by agriculture, infrastructure development, \n  and illegal logging—poses a significant threat to these ecosystems. \n  To counteract this issue, governments and conservation organizations have\n  established protected areas (PAs), which are designated regions where land\n  use is restricted to prevent forest loss. While these areas are intended \n  to preserve forests, their effectiveness is often uncertain. \n  This study aims to evaluate whether Cambodia’s protected areas have\n  successfully reduced deforestation and to what extent they contribute\n  to conservation efforts.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n      Protected areas have had a measurable impact on reducing deforestation, but their success varies widely based on location, enforcement, and external pressures.\n      Some PAs significantly reduced deforestation, particularly those with strong legal enforcement and active management strategies.\n      Many PAs located in high-risk areas (e.g., near expanding agricultural zones and infrastructure projects) were more effective than those in remote, less-threatened regions.            \n      Despite legal protection, deforestation still occurred within some PAs, often due to weak enforcement, illegal logging, or encroachment for agricultural use.\n      The study also found that some PAs were established in areas where deforestation risk was already low, making their protective impact appear greater than it actually was.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Rather than simply comparing protected forests to unprotected ones, \n    this research employed a method known as counterfactual analysis.\n    This technique helps estimate what would have happened if no protections had been put in place. \n    By doing so, the study provides a more accurate assessment of the real impact of protected areas.\n    Without using this approach, it is difficult to determine whether a protected \n    forest remains intact because of conservation policies or simply because \n    it was never at high risk of deforestation.\n    To conduct this analysis, satellite imagery and deforestation data \n    were examined across different regions in Cambodia. Various factors were\n    considered, including land-use policies, road proximity, human population density,\n    and historical deforestation trends. By comparing observed deforestation within PAs \n    to a predicted scenario without protections, the study was able to isolate the true impact of conservation efforts.\n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n      \n    \n     Understanding how well protected areas function is critical for improving\n    conservation strategies. If some PAs are not successfully reducing deforestation,\n    it may indicate a need for better enforcement, improved land management policies,\n    or the establishment of protection in higher-risk areas.\n     This study highlights the importance of using data-driven approaches to\n    evaluate conservation outcomes and ensure that resources are directed\n    toward efforts that have the greatest impact.\n     By refining the selection \n    and management of protected areas, policymakers and conservationists can\n    enhance their effectiveness, ensuring that Cambodia’s forests continue\n    to provide ecological, economic, and social benefits for future generations.\n     This research underscores the need for scientific assessments in\n    conservation planning. By continually monitoring and adapting conservation policies\n    based on evidence, we can create more effective strategies to combat\n    deforestation and preserve Cambodia’s rich forest ecosystems.\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n    \n    \n      Code \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Black, B. \n    \n    Identifying effective area-based conservation strategies under uncertainty \n    Doctoral thesis.
