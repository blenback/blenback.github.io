However, it is worth noting that there may be discrepancies between departments and as such you should check the requirements for your department (My thesis was under D-BAUG).\nI built this template based upon the quarto-phd-thesis template from james-d-h: https://github.com/james-d-h/quarto-phd-thesis, adding some notable features.\nThe template is geared towards producing PDF output as I would imagine this is the most common format that theses must be submitted in.\nHere is the example produced by the template for you to view: Example PDF"

An example of applying the theme_thesis() and scale_color_thesis() functions is provided in chapters/paper-01/paper-01-figs.R:\n\np &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Fuel Efficiency vs. Car Weight\",\n    x = \"Weight (1000 lbs)\",\n    y = \"Miles per Gallon\",\n    color = \"Cylinders\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_thesis(palette = \"test_pal\")+\n  theme_thesis()\n\n\n\nCover page\nThe template allows you to add a coverpage using the quarto_titlepages extension. The cover page YAML options are set in in index.qmd:\n---\nformat: \n  pdf:\n    coverpage: true\n    coverpage-bg-image: \"frontmatter/images/cover_background.png\"\n    coverpage-title: \"Title\"\n    coverpage-footer: \"Subtitle\"\n    coverpage-theme:\n      title-fontfamily: \"FiraSans-Bold.ttf\"\n      title-fontsize: 24\n      title-color: mydarkgreen\n      title-align: \"right\"\n      title-bottom: \"27cm\"\n      title-width: \"20cm\"\n      title-left: \"18cm\"\n      header-style: \"none\"\n      footer-style: \"plain\"\n      footer-fontfamily: \"FiraSans-Regular.ttf\"\n      footer-bottom: \"25cm\"\n      footer-align: \"right\"\n      footer-width: \"20cm\"\n      footer-left: \"18cm\"\n      footer-fontsize: 20\n      footer-color: mydarkgreen\n      date-style: \"none\"\n      bg-image-fading: \"north\"\n      bg-image-opacity: 0.8\n---\nHere I have set the title and subtitle using the extension options but you could just as easily include these manually within your background image. For the details of all the YAML options see the guide for the quarto_titlepages extension:\n\n\nFront matter\n\nTranslated Summary\nThe ETH doctoral regulations stipulate that the thesis must include a translation of the summary or abstract into one of the Swiss national languages (following the English version). I have added a seperate .qmd file to include this and YAML key for specifying the translation of summary in _quarto.yml:\n---\nsummarytitle: Zusammenfassung\n---\n\n\nETH Zurich title page\nTo create the standard ETH title page for thesis I have adapted an existing LaTeX template with the relevant lines included in ETH-thesis-template.cls. Rather than directly editing the LaTeX I have defined YAML keys in partials/title.tex so that the fields can be filled directly in _quarto.yml:\n---\ntitlepage-title: \"Your thesis title\"\ntitlepage-author: \"Jane Doe\"\nsummarytitle: Zusammenfassung\ndegree: DOCTOR OF SCIENCES # Degree title \ndegreedate: 2025 # Year of degree submission\ndissnumber: XXXX # ETH dissertation number\ncitizenship: My home country # Country of citizenship\ndob: September 14, 1993 # Date of birth\nMSctitle: Environmental Policy, Science and Management # Title of MSc dgree\nMScuni: Central European University, University of Manchester, University of Lund, University of the Aegean # University/ies of MSc degree\nexaminer: Prof. Dr. Dwayne Johnson # Your examiner (title and name: Prof. Dr. X)\ncoexaminerone: Prof. Dr. Stevie Irwin # Your 1st co-examiner (title and name: Prof. Dr. X)\ncoexaminertwo: Dr. Brian Gumble # Your 2nd co-examiner (title and name: Prof. Dr. X)\n---\nWhich results in the title page being rendered as:\n\n\n\nRendered ETH title page\n\n\n\n\n\nChapters\nIn the template I have included typical chapters such as the Introduction, State of the Art, Structure, Synthesis and an example of chapter based on a published paper (chapters/paper-01-qmd). Each chapter is a separate .qmd file and you can include/exclude them, or add additional chapters, using the chapters YAML key in _quarto.yml:\nbook: \n  date: last-modified\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd # Used to enter the cover page yaml, glossary, abbreviations, etc.\n    - chapters/introduction/introduction.qmd\n    - chapters/sota/sota.qmd\n    - chapters/structure/structure.qmd\n    - chapters/paper-01/paper-01.qmd\n    - chapters/synthesis/synthesis.qmd\n    - endmatter/references.qmd\n    - endmatter/appendices.qmd\n    - endmatter/CV.qmd\nI have given each chapter a nested sub-directory in order to organize all of the content related to it but this is a personal stylistic decision. However, note that index.qmd, which includes the gloassary must be at the root of the project.\n\nPaper-based chapters\nFor cumulative paper theses the ETH regulations state that the chapters that represent published papers should include relevant details of the original article such as a full citation, date of publication, author contributions highlights and statement regarding any chages to the content.\nTo display this information along with some other details like links to research code and data, I use custom Quarto Callout Blocks at the start of each chapters .qmd:\n\n\n\nCallout block for article details\n\n\nThe code for this is included in chapters/paper-01/paper-01.qmd and it uses the LaTeX latex-credits package to produce the visualization of the author CRediT roles (Note this package is not available via CTAN so is included directly with the template LaTeX_pkgs/credits.sty).\n\n\nUpdating/including figures\nMy preferred method of preparing figures for Quarto documents is to produce and save them via dedicated R scripts rather than directly within the .qmd files themselves. This R script is then sourced directly at the head of the respective .qmd file to ensure the most up to date figures are used and the images are then included for each figure as in paper-01.qmd:\n\n#source the script that prepares all the figures\nsource(\"chapters/paper-01/paper-01-figs.R\")\n\n![Dummy figure](figures/dummy_plot.png){#fig-dummy} \n\nI do this because I find that when I have multiple figures with quite lengthy code it can make navigating the document a bit annoying. Again, this is a stylistic choice and you should feel free to include figure code directly within the .qmd’s.\n\n\n\nEnd matter\n\nReferences\nendmatter/references.qmd places a div to ensure that all references for all chapters are placed in this section:\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\nAppendices\nI have elected to have all appendices for each chapter be placed together after the reference list rather than after their respective chapters. As far I know the ETH regulations are ambiguous as to which of these options is preferred but given that I tend to have have long appendices this was preferable for me.\nI have also chosen to use Alpha-numeric (e.g. A.1) section numbering for the appendices which is specified at the head of endmatter/appendices.qmd before the .qmd files for the individual appendices for each chapter are sourced in sequence. Note: if you add additional chapters you will need to add lines to source the appendices in endmatter/appendices.qmd.\n\n\nCurriculum vitae\nThe ETH regulations require that you include your curriculum vitae at the end of your thesis, CV.qmd uses the LaTeX command \\includepdf[pages=-]{} to add in your CV from a provided .pdf."

This is also a task I find especially time-consuming given that you end up chopping and changing what is included based upon different applications which inevitably leads to endlessly messing around with the formatting to keep things neat. I also don’t have much sense for design, and in fact the format of my previous CV was very kindly made for me by my partner.\nHowever, recently I found myself needing an up to date CV to share with project funders and so I thought it was time to invest in a new format and try to mitigate some of the headaches of updating the content in the future.\nI knew I wanted a more modern format, complete with social links, a picture and a more bold design so I opted for the pagedown::html_resume format which I adapted from the updates made by Mickaël Canouil (who is always doing cool Quarto projects).\nSome nerdy features about this format/approach that I like:\n\nAlthough it is rendered with Rmarkdown, the raw inputs for most of the sections are entered directly in a simple Excel file.\nThe publications are read from a Bibtex. file which I can keep updated using Zotero (my academic library software of choice).\nThe document is rebuilt automatically every time it is committed to the remote git repo using a github action\nIt renders as both HTML and PDF simultaneously\nI can apply other templates and easily control which sections are included when applications require different types of CVs\n\nI added some personal touches to make it my own, including additional, academia relevant, social links to the side bar such as ResearchGate and ORCID, as well as a languages section. I also wrote some code to utilise custom entries within my bibtex file to add different links to entries. For example, links to the slides for my presentations (hosted here on my website), the papers and code for my publications and project-specific websites I have created. Here is the final result:\n\n  \n\nand if you want to do do something similar here is the github repo"

First for a charity called The Conservation Volunteers in Scotland, leading groups of volunteers in a range of projects from Peatland restoration and woodland management, to constructing gardens in schools. Then for several years with a small eco-tourism, conservation and community development NGO, Elephant Livelihood Initiative Environment, in North-Eastern Cambodia.\nIn Cambodia, I saw the challenges of implementing conservation programs in protected areas and was really motivated to move towards a career in conservation practice. This led to short periods of work with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS).\nBetween 2018-2020, I undertook an Erasmus Mundus 2-year Masters program in Environmental Science Policy and Management. Starting in Budapest for before relocating to the island of Lesvos in Greece and then Manchester in the UK. Finally, I chose to write my thesis back in Budapest just in time for the start of the pandemic.\nFreshly graduated I was fortunate enough find a PhD position in Zürich. What really drew me to my position was that I would be working as part of a research project with applied outcomes for environmental protection in Switzerland. Two years on and I can safely say that it was one of the best decisions I have made!"

They used a sophisticated spatial simulation model to test how different choices might shape the landscape between 2020 and 2060.\n\n\n\n\n  🔍 Key Findings\n  \n    Normative scenarios led to more sustainable landscapes compared to business-as-usual or worst-case scenarios.\n    Urban expansion and landscape fragmentation were much higher in exploratory scenarios.\n    Protected area expansion and land use zoning helped maintain ecological connectivity and reduce sprawl.\n    Expert feedback was mixed: while useful, users found it hard to engage with highly detailed simulation maps.\n    Key challenge: making spatial simulation results easily interpretable for strategic decision-making.\n  \n\n\n\n  🧪 Methods\n  \n    Five future scenarios were simulated using a Land Use and Land Cover Change - Constrained Cellular Automata (LULCC-CCA) model.\n    Inputs were derived from expert workshops, demographic projections, climate models, and economic data.\n    Each scenario was defined by different values and goals, aligned with the IPBES “Nature Futures Framework.”\n    Scenario elements included:\n      \n      Dynamic climate and population drivers\n      Land use transition rules and probabilities\n      Spatial interventions like zoning and protected areas\n    \n  \n  Model validation included comparison with historical land use and feedback from experts via an interactive web platform.\n\n\n\n\n  🌱 Implications\n  \n    Normative scenarios support sustainability: This approach can help plan land use that protects biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n    Participatory modelling is essential: Combining expert and stakeholder input ensures models reflect diverse values.\n    Better communication tools are needed: To involve more people in decision-making, simulation results must be clearer and more accessible.\n    Future planning can benefit from scenario modelling by identifying trade-offs and synergies before decisions are made.\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n    \n      Data \n    \n    \n      Code \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Wicki, S., Black, B., Kurmann, M., Grêt-Regamey, A. \n    2023\n    Archetypes of social-ecological-technological systems for managing ecological infrastructure. \n    Environ.

Using Geneva, Switzerland as a case study, we applied a systems-based approach \n  combining social, ecological, and technological data to create spatial archetypes. These archetypes help identify how \n  different types of landscapes function and what strategies might work best to support nature and human well-being.\n\n\n\n\n🔍 Key Findings\n\n  Seven distinct landscape archetypes were identified across Geneva, such as “Concrete Jungle” and “Green Frontier.”\n  There is a strong disconnect between ecological conditions and social/technological systems in dense urban areas.\n  Some archetypes (e.g., Cultivated Oasis) offer high ecological benefits and biodiversity, while others (e.g., Concrete Jungle) are underperforming ecologically.\n  Tailored management strategies are needed for each archetype, considering their social and ecological roles.\n  Stakeholders emphasized the importance of collaboration, incentives, and spatial planning to implement EI effectively.\n\n\n\n\n🧪 Methods\n\n  Used a Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS) framework with high-resolution spatial data (25m grid).\n  Gathered data on biodiversity, infrastructure, demographics, and ecosystem services (Nature’s Contributions to People).\n  Applied machine learning (PCA and clustering) to group Geneva’s landscape into 7 archetypes based on SETS variables.\n  Engaged stakeholders in interviews and workshops to validate data and develop policy recommendations per archetype.\n  Mapped current and projected land use change (to 2060) to

Social and ecological systems must be aligned through smart design and regulation.\n  EI is not one-size-fits-all: Policies should reflect regional variation in land use and biodiversity potential.\n  Stakeholder engagement is essential: Co-producing knowledge ensures practical, accepted solutions.\n  Transferable approach: This archetype method can be applied to other urban regions worldwide to

(LULCC) is predicted using models called cellular automata. \n  Typically, models are only evaluated after they simulate changes, but this paper shows that checking the predictions \n  earlier in the process—called stage 1 validation—can make models more accurate and easier to understand.\n\n\n\n\n  🔍 Key Findings\n  \n    Stage 1 validation improves transparency: Early checks reveal problems hidden in final map-only evaluations.\n    Not all transition models perform equally: Some predictions were unreliable despite using advanced methods.\n    Individual model checks help: Looking at transitions separately exposes weak areas like data imbalance.\n    Predictor selection improves models: Removing unnecessary inputs improved performance, especially for logistic regression.\n    Random Forests generally outperformed Logistic Regression, but were less sensitive to input refinement.\n  \n\n\n\n🧪 Methods\n\n  Study Area: Land cover transitions across Switzerland from 2009 to 2018 were analyzed.\n  Data: Swiss national land use datasets were combined with environmental and spatial predictors (e.g., elevation, soil, roads).\n  Models: Transition potential (TP) models were built using Logistic Regression and Random Forests for 174 specific land change scenarios.\n  Validation: \n    \n      Stage 1 validation: Assessed how well TP models predicted transition probabilities before simulation.\n      Stage 2 validation: Compared simulated maps to observed maps (used less in this study).\n    \n  \n  Performance Metrics: ROC AUC and Boyce Index were used to evaluate model accuracy and generalizability.\n  Variable Selection: A two-step method reduced redundant predictors, tested for model performance and efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n  🌱 Implications\n  \n    More efficient calibration: Stage 1 saves time by avoiding full simulations for every tweak.\n    Improved interpretability: Helps users understand and trust predictions, important for policy-making.\n    Need for better tools: A shared calibration protocol would benefit land change modelling broadly.\n    Supports sustainable planning: Better models mean better decisions for urban growth, agriculture, and nature.\n  \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n      Preprint \n    \n    \n    \n      Code \n    \n    \n  \n\n  \n    Black, B., Anthony, B.P. \n

Conservation\n    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02228\n    \n    \n    \n     Plain Langauge Summary \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n  \n  📝 Overview\n  Forests play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by storing \n  carbon, supporting biodiversity, and regulating climate patterns. However,\n  rapid deforestation—caused by agriculture, infrastructure development, \n  and illegal logging—poses a significant threat to these ecosystems. \n  To counteract this issue, governments and conservation organizations have\n  established protected areas (PAs), which are designated regions where land\n  use is restricted to prevent forest loss. While these areas are intended \n  to preserve forests, their effectiveness is often uncertain. \n  This study aims to evaluate whether Cambodia’s protected areas have\n  successfully reduced deforestation and to what extent they contribute\n  to conservation efforts.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  🔍 Key Findings\n  \n      Protected areas have had a measurable impact on reducing deforestation, but their success varies widely based on location, enforcement, and external pressures.\n      Some PAs significantly reduced deforestation, particularly those with strong legal enforcement and active management strategies.\n      Many PAs located in high-risk areas (e.g., near expanding agricultural zones and infrastructure projects) were more effective than those in remote, less-threatened regions.            \n      Despite legal protection, deforestation still occurred within some PAs, often due to weak enforcement, illegal logging, or encroachment for agricultural use.\n      The study also found that some PAs were established in areas where deforestation risk was already low, making their protective impact appear greater than it actually was.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  🧪 Methods\n    Rather than simply comparing protected forests to unprotected ones, \n    this research employed a method known as counterfactual analysis.\n    This technique helps estimate what would have happened if no protections had been put in place. \n    By doing so, the study provides a more accurate assessment of the real impact of protected areas.\n    Without using this approach, it is difficult to determine whether a protected \n    forest remains intact because of conservation policies or simply because \n    it was never at high risk of deforestation.\n    To conduct this analysis, satellite imagery and deforestation data \n    were examined across different regions in Cambodia. Various factors were\n    considered, including land-use policies, road proximity, human population density,\n    and historical deforestation trends. By comparing observed deforestation within PAs \n    to a predicted scenario without protections, the study was able to isolate the true impact of conservation efforts.\n    \n    \n  \n\n  🌱 Implications\n      \n    \n     Understanding how well protected areas function is critical for improving\n    conservation strategies. If some PAs are not successfully reducing deforestation,\n    it may indicate a need for better enforcement, improved land management policies,\n    or the establishment of protection in higher-risk areas.\n     This study highlights the importance of using data-driven approaches to\n    evaluate conservation outcomes and ensure that resources are directed\n    toward efforts that have the greatest impact.\n     By refining the selection \n    and management of protected areas, policymakers and conservationists can\n    enhance their effectiveness, ensuring that Cambodia’s forests continue\n    to provide ecological, economic, and social benefits for future generations.\n     This research underscores the need for scientific assessments in\n    conservation planning. By continually monitoring and adapting conservation policies\n    based on evidence, we can create more effective strategies to combat\n    deforestation and preserve Cambodia’s rich forest ecosystems.\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n     Cite \n     \n    \n    \n    \n      Code \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\nTheses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Black, B. \n    \n    Identifying effective area-based conservation strategies under uncertainty \n    Doctoral thesis.
